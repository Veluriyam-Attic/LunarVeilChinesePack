	// Basic5: I don't mean trouble, but do as you please.
	// Special1: An old time there was a thriving capital, we used to call it the Harboring Morrow. It was a thriving city under the protection of Gothivia, Verlia, and Irradia. I used to be a member. Gothivia loved every one of us, Verlia would be off directing armies and Irradia well she spent time making electronics.
	// Special2: Irradia would make amazing tech, and I would come to every show she would host and watch her mechanic sword fights and spare parts, Verlia would sometimes participate and tear all of them apart. Verlia was just too good of a swordsman.
	// Special3: Gothivia would always come down at 10 A.M in the morning to greet all the city members, it used to be the time of my life. She'd give us goodies and Rek would come by with his binding light to empower the underground and brighten things up.
	// Special4: Verlia and Gothivia are sisters, although they don't look it anymore, they used to be twins yet they couldn't be different from each other. Verlia was always rambunctious and outgoing while Gothivia was a calm and loving soul, the two got along.
	// Special5: Of all the inventions Irradia made, by far my favorite was a rendition of Gothivia's Rek called Havoc. It was a magnificent beast. It held it's own against Verlia in the shows, if only I could go back to those days.
	// Special6: Verlia always would be training the army, the gintze army wasn't exactly the most reliable mainly because of Verlia's idiocity and lack of care for danger. The army would always charge head first without a care for defense. I wonder where the army was when we were defending against the Carian warriors and knights
	// Special7: Some days I look back on the Harboring Morrow and wonder why we fell so hard. I remember BORDOC, an excellent blacksmith but too arrogant to read his ways. Irradia taught me some amazing things I carry with me today and all the people. the people...
	// Special8: You know, I had loved Irradia, until we seperated through war our connection was magically I would say. Damn witches and their artistry. I don't hate magic, but its the reason I lost so much. That commander, I will never forget the smirk on that face. So called Fenix and her army of Carian knights.
	// Special9: One day in the Harboring Morrow, the most joyous of days, some collectors came back infected by some strange disease, as you may know now it's called the Virulent. An acid like corruption that eats at the soul. It tore our village apart like the black plague. It weakened us, right before a Carian army swept us away at our worst, we stood no chance.
	// Special10: Verlia one day left the Morrow to search and make peace with the witches in the upcoming villages, she was by far the most magical out of the three of them, so she would stand a chance to help, when she came back, she was out of her mind.
	// Special11: When Verlia came back from her excursion, she well, gave information that changed the course of our lives. Me being in a relationship with Irradia I was able to be let in on that information. She shared to us a tome from a small witch village. This would a fatal mistake.
	// Special12: Verlia's excursion took place right when the corruption started occuring, she went to look for a way to heal the damaged. Gothivia would do her best to heal everyone but she was only one person in the biggest capital in terraria.
	// Special13: One harrowing day, a fox appears at the doorstep of Verlia and Gothivia's abode. I knew my eyes decieved me when I had seen the fox transform into a tall Nero, they are like human cats but I thought they'd been extinct for millenia!
	// Special14: When a fox arrived on the doorsteps of our beloved, The fox lady brings out what I can only think was a lantern and all I could make out inside that room was a giant blue flash and the screams of Gothivia. This was the last time anyone heard of Verlia.
	// Special15: After what I call the 'blue flash,' everyone hurried to a sign of screaming in the middle of the night. We all come to see Gothivia crying with a note in her hand and the fox lady. She introduced herself as Fenix.
	// Special16: Fenix was a tall statured woman yet extremely menacing, at times a lot of us thought she may have been more powerful than Gothivia, but deep down Gothivia's suppressed feelings for her family would probably overcome that.
	// Special17: The illnesses started to rack up and since Verlia disappeared, our Harboring Morrow was not complete, there was nobody to keep our armies in check, Gothivia wasn't mentally there anymore and Irradia was trying her best to get everyone to calm down. It was a horrible time.
	// Special18: Irradia did explain what happened to Verlia, but I thought it was just downright evil. Fenix trapped Verlia's soul inside a lantern and bounded it to a secret power for experimentation because she stole a book from their village. We'll never get to see her again will we?
	// Special19: I think Irradia's way of coping to the loss of Verlia was teaching me now that Im starting to recollect. She may have used it as a way of reflecting, and I didn't see that she was hurting yet I was always there for her.
	// Special20: I kept on living, hell I even got sick from the Virulent, yet I was Gothivia's last person to get healed from her. Rek eventually got infected too yet since havoc was electronic, he stayed normal. The creatures that lived the best were mostly metallic, its what remains of our old village.
	// Special21: After the last healing in from Gothivia, I'd say about 90% of our village was wiped out from the Virulent, our soliders, our love, and will to live all started to fall apart.
	// Special22: I could recall me laying on a bed as I watched our city crumble, Irradia would stay by my side and we'd comfort each other as the world caved in for us.
	// Special23: After a while of our suffering in the city Gothivia would leave to seek vengence and power to save her sister, leaving Irradia to be at the helm. Take a guess who arrived not so soon afterwards? Fenix, she came to take what was left of us.
	// Special24: Fenix is like a scouraging raven looking for its next feast, and we were on the menu. I was forced to split from my love due to her sacrifices of being a leader. We haven't seen each other since, yet I know she's out there somewhere. No way would she loose to Fenix...
	// Special25: The Great Departure, that's what I call the leaving from what was left in our city. As the Carian army approached, we hid through underground tunnels to escape, some of us, including me, haven't gone back to the surface. I was even invited to come to the Fable.
	// Special26: Those who made it to the surface from the Great Departure reinvented the Harboring Morrow yet from all the messages from BORDOC, it isn't the same. They close their doors to everyone in fear and they look for Gothivia, she never said where she went.
	// Special27: I was in tunnels underground for 10 of my years, now I lay here with all the corpses and electronics that I bear, I've travelled every part of this world except the surface, to ever find Fenix again would send me over my limit.
	// Special28: You know, maybe I should have travelled with the rest of the members of the morrow, many of us split up in our escape, many died, hell, maybe I'm the only standing survivor, but I'm here.
	// Special29: My creations that I make now are from my explorations, I will find Irradia again, I need to apologize, to say something. These are all for her anyway. If only I could have stopped this from getting this way, maybe I could have stayed against her will.
	// Special30: Of all my years to live and ever to live, I will never understand things like Fenix, her torturous additude, why she went to such lengths to kill us, why the infection was so hard to fend off, and why I couldn't stay, these are all for you, Irradia.

	// Special7: I love myself commissions, just sayingg if you wanna commission me I'm all available, the last person I went to kill was some goofy guy named Rallad, some girl named Sylia asked me if I could do it for her since she didnt want to be seen, took forever to find him though.

	// Special9: The small joys of life comes from not having your house destroyed by some malevolent gods throwing down their trap cards when youre trying to sleep. It makes me annoyed when I have to peek out my window to make sure the black hole isn't going to hit my house.

	// Downed1: Kill the stone guardian, commander gintzia will soon raid you with his army of failed troops from the govheil. He will be very easy so take him swiftly and beat him into submission hun.
	// Downed2: I'd recommend going into the Fabled Swamp over to the right or collecting resources to get ready to fight either Jack or find a sun alter in a desert and prepare for Sunstalker! Zui may be a good person to talk to in the witch village for quest items too :)
	// Downed3: Nice babe, I want you to go kill Jack in the Fabled swamp on the right then, you need a wandering essence and he shouldn't be too difficult.
	// Downed4: Nice work! I want you to go headhunt a bird in the desert, his name is Sunstalker and they are a bit challenging but less so than the last, collect some mandibles in the desert to make the Sun stone! Find the alter on the surface of a desert!
	// Downed5: You're next target is Daedus, he's a strong one. Hes a very loyal Guardian to one of the biggest threats here being Gothivia, we need him gone to get to the big fish in the sea. For some reason he holds some power of a singularity so beware. He resides low in the temple in the Fabled Swamp, no extra preperation needed.
	// Downed6: Oh my gosh nice, so here's where things are going to get difficult. If a blood moon happens we need to exterminate Dreadmire, she spawns after killing a blood cyst during a blood moon, you can also get some terror fragments too! She'll pose too much of a threat if we let her live. She's I think one of the three sisters, formally known as cozmire. She needs to die and after that I'll give some great rewards.
	// Downed7: We are making big progress now! I don't know if you have been killing other ravenous monsters but I'd recommend doing so as the next one on our list is Verlia but to get to her we have quite a few things to do first. Make yourself a void key and find a temple deep in the ice biome, there should be some loot and hopefully an alter that'll give you a lantern. She was trapped by Fenix but she needs to die so we can bring out Gothivia.
	// Downed8: Ok you got the lantern! Go to the cathedral overtop the ice biome and summon her at the top at night. This will be our biggest foe yet but I know you can kill her, sorry Aimacra is tired of being my assasin so it's your turn.
	// Downed9: Oh damn this is great. I think that completes our list for now, check back in with me in Hardmode! We'll purify this world of all danger and create peace and then we can be together and move on. Thank you again.
	// Downed10: Welp here we go again. So theres a strange issue we have, so Daedus isn't the only barrier to trying to stop us from getting to Gothivia, Aimacra just went and explored around and found some new places and there was this castle underground in a green biome? I noticed Gothivia's marks on it and the Sun hasnt started turning green, could you look at that? There should be some catacombs underground in the desert, ocean and caverns to help power up too.
	// Downed11: There was a person down there claiming to be Gothiva? Thats strange. Gothivia seems to be making an appearance on the world. Apparently things are changing the skies and things are falling from them, Beware of 星 爆 者S, Aimacra warned me that they were manufactured here as well as Ekrose and you have experience with them.
	// Downed12: I didn't think Rosemary's creations would've made it here. Ekrose sure does have an affect on this world. I saw some strange disturbance on the left side of the underworld though, can you check that out? I went to talk to Veldris and he told me Sylia may be up to some demonic magic that could ruin our process, so killing her is a good option.
	// Downed13: It was a void witch... Interesting. Must be related to that Merena person Aimacra talked about. I haven't been to the Royal Capital much, mainly because it's so far out but maybe we should kill the Queen there, she is definitely extremely powerful but I don't really know how to talk to her, I haven't seen her yet. If you can could you go kill her for us?
	// Downed14: Ereshkigal huh? I think I know her, she also isn't supposed to be here. However she got lost I guess we can give her some sense
	// Downed15: Weheeee! You're doing so well! I can like get off to this! I'm kidding :(. Maybe you can try and explore around some more. We need to prepare for moonlord!
	// Downed16: I did not expect you to want to kill her honestly. I went and explored around and she seemed nice. Wait you didn't kill her? Oh dang, well she isn't on our list anyway so it's fine lmao. She isn't causing us any issues.
	// Downed17: Ok ok we got some good stuff done. Time for Gothivia as she's not particularly the worst but she keeps inspiring bad people to do ad things and we need to teach her not to do that.
	// Downed18: Maybe we shouldn't have killed her, I don't know if there was a reason to kill Niivi. You just wanted weapons and gear? I mean if it helps I guess. She was doing more good than harm
	// Downed19: Okie dokie, Gothivia has agree to stay calm so we aren't going to assassinate her anymore, I feel bad for killing her sister now. I hope Vixyl doesn't find out.
